# Production log

Append-only. One entry per action: timestamp, step, what, exact command/prompt/script, outputs, why.

## 2026-10-17T11:18:53-04:00 — Setup: repo scaffolding

- **What:** Created directory layout, `.gitignore`, a pre-commit hook rejecting staged files over 50 MiB, and `scripts/manifest.sh` (SHA-256 manifest of large files).
- **Commands:** `mkdir -p log/prompts/suno scripts/hooks docs lyrics audio/track audio/stems reference/inspiration reference/stills archive style timing shots`; `git config core.hooksPath scripts/hooks`
- **Outputs:** `.gitignore`, `scripts/hooks/pre-commit`, `scripts/manifest.sh`, `log/production_log.md`, `log/human_interventions.md`
- **Why:** Brief, "Production rules": set up `.gitignore` and the 50 MiB check before the first commit.
- **Environment:** Claude Code (Opus 5.5); Blender 5.2.2 LTS; ffmpeg 8.0.1; Python 3.14.4; git. Node is **not installed** (needed for Puppeteer). GPU is a **GTX 970**, not the RTX 5090 listed in the brief.
